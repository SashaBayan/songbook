walk into the dining room
table’s set
white cloth bright lights radio cassette
Judith has a sweet tooth
lucky we’ve got honey
Edmund brought the cookies
to fill up all our tummies

wine glass tea cup i don't care
i just want your love to share
pass the sugar brown not white
save some room for Turkish delight

Tom fell from the chair onto his face, to his face
Suzie get the pillows, do make haste
Teddy bears have cuddles
but they don’t stand up straight
mirrors, chairs, and puddles
clean up all your plates!

wine glass tea cup i don't care
i just want your love to share
pass the sugar brown not white
save some room for Turkish delight

who ate all my Turkish delight!?
